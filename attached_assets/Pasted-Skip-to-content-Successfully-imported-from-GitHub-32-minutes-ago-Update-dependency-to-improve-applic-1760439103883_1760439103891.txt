Update dependency to improve application performance and stability
1 Run yarn install
2. Run npx expo install
Run npx expo install --check
4 run npx expo-doctor
Run npx expo start
Then you view on web
Then this are what you will do

We will take each screens one after the other so you will improve each screen add all features of each screen to be exactly WhatsApp replica I will give you screenshot example
You will find the original image background WhatsApp uses in the chat view screen for both dark and light mode
You will make the theme dark light and system preference effective everywhere
The contact screen should should be exactly as WhatsApp contact screen with the ability to save contact save new contact and detect if the contact is on WhatsApp or not
The chat view screen should be exactly as WhatsApp having the same image background WhatsApp had for both light and dark displays and included in the wallpaper option,
The most worst out of it is the nav bar entering all part of the app
And the status bar as well
7 the update screen should have everything inside updates screen of officially WhatsApp and every alert shiuld8be just plain white test should be user attractive ND well formatted
The post status status row and others
The option menu of the header in each screen has different options the option drop down in chatscren header is different from the update and different from the call and rest as WhatsApp has
We leave the app running as you make changes and I will always put my eyes on the monitor to see the changes cos the backend is already hosted and running and my session is already populated, that's

I'll help you get this WhatsApp clone running in Replit! Let me first explore the codebase to understand its structure, then set it up properly.

Let me search the Replit documentation to understand how to handle package installation issues in this environment.

I see the issue! The workflow is waiting for permission to install Expo. Let me install Expo properly first, then restart the workflow.

I see the issue - the global expo-cli is deprecated and causing conflicts. Let me fix this by using the local Expo CLI instead.

Let me check the current state of packages and fix the Expo installation:

Perfect! Expo CLI is working now (version 54.0.11). The binary exists at node_modules/.bin/expo. Now I need to restart the workflow. Let me try using the full path to the expo binary or use the script from package.json.

Actually, looking back at the package.json, I see that the "start" script uses "expo start" directly. Let me try using "yarn start --web --port 5000 --host 0.0.0.0" instead.

Or I can use the direct path to the expo binary. Let me try the script approach first since it's cleaner.

Great! Expo is installed and working. Let me restart the workflow using the proper command:

I see the issues:

--non-interactive is not supported, need to use CI=1 instead
--host 0.0.0.0 is not valid for Expo, it expects 'lan', 'tunnel', or 'localhost'
For Expo web, I should use:

Remove --host 0.0.0.0 (not needed for web)
Use CI=1 environment variable instead of --non-interactive
Let me fix the workflow command.

I see the issue. Let me fix the workflow command with the correct parameters for Expo:

Excellent! The server is running successfully on port 5000. Let me take a screenshot to verify the app is working properly:

I see Metro is still bundling the app (42.5% complete). Let me wait for it to finish:

I found the issue! The app is trying to load a WhatsApp dark background image that doesn't exist. Let me fix this:

I'll fix the missing dark background image issue. For now, I'll use a solid color for the dark WhatsApp pattern:

Checked system logs
Checked logs
Reading log files in detail
Good! The server is responding with HTML. The logs look the same as before - it's waiting and bundling. Let me wait a bit more and then try to take a screenshot. The bundling might still be in progress. Let me grep the log file to see if there are bundling progress messages.

Now I see the critical error! The JavaScript bundle is being served with the wrong MIME type (application/json instead of application/javascript). This is preventing the app from loading. Let me search for a solution:

I found another reference to the missing dark background image! Let me search for all occurrences and fix them:

Now I can edit the file. Let me fix the reference to the missing dark background image.

Checked console and system logs
Excellent! The app bundled successfully! Let me take a screenshot to verify it's working properly:

Screenshot
Perfect! The app is now running successfully! I can see the WhatsApp welcome screen with the Connexa branding.

Now I need to enable hot reloading so you can see changes as they happen. Currently, it's running in CI mode which disables automatic reloads. Let me fix that:

Excellent! The server is now running with hot reloading enabled. I can see the app is loading and already attempting to connect with the stored phone number. Now let me set up deployment configuration:

Now let me update the project documentation with the current setup:

Perfect! Now let me complete the project import:
